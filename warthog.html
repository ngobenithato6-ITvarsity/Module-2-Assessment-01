                <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                <p>Phacochoerus is a genus in the family Suidae, commonly known as warthogs (pronounced wart-hog). It is the sole genus of subfamily Phacochoerinae. These pigs live in open and semi-open habitats, even in quite arid regions, in sub-Saharan Africa. </p>
                <p>Although covered in bristly hairs, their bodies and heads appear largely naked from a distance, with only the crest along the back, and the tufts on their cheeks and tails being obviously haired. </p>
                <p>They also have very distinct tusks, which reach a length of 25.5 to 63.5 centimetres (10 to 25 inches) in the males, but are always smaller in the females</p>
